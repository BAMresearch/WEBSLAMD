"""
We explicitly choose to have dedicated forms for different building materials even though the code looks similar.
However, we do not want to create a tight coupling between different use cases which can diverge in the future.
Furthermore in case we are adding more and more types of building materials, dedicated forms (and corresponding HTML files)
lead too much more flexibility and extensibility.

IMPORTANT: The order of the elements (as specified by their labels and within the corresponding HTML form) is not
arbitrary but reflects a structure which is also expected in 'sort_for_concrete_formulation' within MaterialsFacade. As
this is used to create batches of material formulations (for concrete), we need to make sure that the sorting is always
properly synchronized.
